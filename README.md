Gruntworker
===========

Gruntworker ([@twbs-grunt](https://github.com/twbs-grunt)) periodically grabs changes, runs build scripts, and pushes built changes back to the Bootstrap git repo.

It automatically keeps Bootstrap's `/dist/` files up-to-date. It is suited to Bootstrap's specific needs and does not attempt to be generic or useful out-of-the-box for other projects.
